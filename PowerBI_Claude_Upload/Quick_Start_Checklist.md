UNION ALL
SELECT 'fact_occupancyrentarea', COUNT(*) FROM fact_occupancyrentarea
UNION ALL
SELECT 'dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant', COUNT(*) FROM dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant

-- Check for missing relationships
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as orphaned_records
FROM fact_total f
LEFT JOIN dim_property p ON f.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE p.property_id IS NULL
```
