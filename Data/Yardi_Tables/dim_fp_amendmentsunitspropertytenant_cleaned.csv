While the rent is slightly below market ($13.5), we believe it was important to secure this 151,000 SF tenant in-place, to avoid 9-12 months of downtime starting in early 2026. Faropoint has insisted on 4% rent escalations over 10 years. In addition, we have moved the tenant to Faropoint form lease, which will allow the tenant to focus on operations, and for Faropoint to take over repair and maintenance of building systems and ensure the property remains in the best condition. Finally, in case of an early termination we have included a termination penalty.     To mitigate future re-leasing risk, Faropoint initiated an early renewal with Marcolin, extending their lease well ahead of the 2026 expiration. As part of this strategy, the tenant space will undergo a full office refresh. In parallel, the business plan includes significant base building enhancements, such as a new HVAC system ($550K), interior and exterior painting ($500K), window and façade upgrades ($200K), and updated lighting ($200K), along with several smaller projects aimed to improve long-term asset functionality.     This site serves as Marcolin’s U.S. distribution HQ. The tenant, formerly Viva, has occupied the space since 1997 and was acquired by Marcolin in 2015. The Italian executive team—including the CEO, CFO, and heads of Design and Marketing—will be based at this location. The prior Absolute NNN lease required Marcolin to manage all building systems, which proved burdensome given their core business in eyewear. Faropoint’s whiteboxing and office upgrade align with the tenant’s operational needs. Prior to lease execution, Faropoint collaborated closely with Marcolin, architects, and vendors to define a detailed scope for tenant improvements. Any scope changes or cost overruns will be covered by the tenant. | Auto-superseded on 2025-08-09 due to duplicate active status",0

While the rent is slightly below market ($13.5), we believe it was important to secure this 151,000 SF tenant in-place, to avoid 9-12 months of downtime starting in early 2026. Faropoint has insisted on 4% rent escalations over 10 years. In addition, we have moved the tenant to Faropoint form lease, which will allow the tenant to focus on operations, and for Faropoint to take over repair and maintenance of building systems and ensure the property remains in the best condition. Finally, in case of an early termination we have included a termination penalty.         To mitigate future re-leasing risk, Faropoint initiated an early renewal with Marcolin, extending their lease well ahead of the 2026 expiration. As part of this strategy, the tenant space will undergo a full office refresh. In parallel, the business plan includes significant base building enhancements, such as a new HVAC system ($550K), interior and exterior painting ($500K), window and façade upgrades ($200K), and updated lighting ($200K), along with several smaller projects aimed to improve long-term asset functionality.         This site serves as Marcolin’s U.S. distribution HQ. The tenant, formerly Viva, has occupied the space since 1997 and was acquired by Marcolin in 2015. The Italian executive team—including the CEO, CFO, and heads of Design and Marketing—will be based at this location. The prior Absolute NNN lease required Marcolin to manage all building systems, which proved burdensome given their core business in eyewear. Faropoint’s whiteboxing and office upgrade align with the tenant’s operational needs. Prior to lease execution, Faropoint collaborated closely with Marcolin, architects, and vendors to define a detailed scope for tenant improvements. Any scope changes or cost overruns will be covered by the tenant.",150

The tenant was chasing a few deals in the market but we were able to persuade them into going with our building.

Tenant is getting 5 months of free net rent to do their office buildout and move from their other location.

Tenant was an inherited lease at acquisition, with a renewal option at FMV. Budget initially anticipated a $7.09 MR for this but the Conyers submarket has had some softening over the past 12mo, making it difficult to find relevant comps, in particular, comps for a multi-tenant WH user like this. Negotiations were started at $7.35 and TT responding at $5.95.
