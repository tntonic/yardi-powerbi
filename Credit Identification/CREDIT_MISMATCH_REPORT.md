## Root Causes of Mismatches

1. **Token Fuzzy Matching Issues**: The algorithm matches based on partial word similarities, leading to false positives between unrelated companies in similar industries.

2. **Parent Company Confusion**: Many mismatches occur when the algorithm matches to parent companies or subsidiaries with different names.

3. **Industry Similarity**: Companies in the same industry (e.g., tire companies, packaging companies) are often incorrectly matched to each other.

4. **Missing Customer IDs**: Several records lack customer IDs, preventing proper folder creation and tracking.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Manual Review**: All HIGH risk mismatches (similarity < 50%) should be manually reviewed
2. **Correct File Assignment**: Replace incorrect credit files in affected folders
3. **Update CSV Data**: Correct all confirmed mismatches in the database

### Process Improvements
1. **Increase Match Threshold**: Require minimum 80% similarity for automatic matching
2. **Industry Validation**: Add industry code checking to prevent cross-industry matches
3. **Manual Override List**: Maintain a list of known correct matches to override fuzzy logic
4. **Regular Audits**: Run mismatch detection script monthly to catch new issues
