3. Only the Estimated Amount for Additional Rent (Insurance and Real Estate Taxes) is known. Hence, we have flat lined the last known amount till Expiration date.
4. Payment Frequency for Management Fee to be within 30 days following demand, which is conditional. Hence, we have abstracted the Base Rent frequency (monthly) for the same.
5. As per Client's feedback, we have abstracted the rent as stated in the Schedule 1 for both Warehouse and Office spaces.
6. Per Lease, Sec. 4.7, RE Taxes amount to be stated for both Warehouse and Office $7,293.38/month ($1.50/annum/SF for an area of 58,347 SF).

Prepaid Rent: Upon execution, Tenant to pay Landlord, 1st month rent and last month rent excluding sales tax. (1st Amendment, Pg. 1-2; Lease, Sec. 2, Pg. 5)

Rent Abatement: Rent to be abated for the Period form 06/01/2013 to 09/30/2013. (Lease, Sec. 4, Pg. 6)

Sales Tax: Tenant shall also pay any applicable sales taxes at the same time. (Lease, Sec. 4, Pg. 6, Sec. 56, Pg. 24)

Note: 1. Per Lease, Document date is only Year (2013) are available, we have abstracted the Commencement date as Document date (ie. 06/01/2013)
2. Exhibit B and Exhibit C referred in the Lease are missing. 
3. Lease Term to expire on 09/30/2023 with 1-5 years renewal option. As per Client's feedback, ""Seller is unable to provide the missing documents. Please abstract the remaining leases without these documents"". So, we have assumed that the option is exercised and abstracted the expiration date as 09/30/2028.
4. The term is set for 64 months starting from 06/01/2013. According to Sec. 4, rent was specified for months 54 to 65. However, we have adjusted the rent end date to align with the term of 64 months.
5. Tenant to pay Landlord, Sales tax on Base Rent, whereas Sales tax % is not available in the Lease. Hence we have assumed and abstracted 7% as per web search.
