## Phase 3: Development Testing and Validation

### Step 3.1: Accuracy Validation
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Owner:** BI Analyst  

1. **Python Baseline Comparison**
   ```
   Test Dataset: Fund 2, June 30, 2025
   Python Baseline Results:
   - Target Monthly Rent: $5.11M
   - Target Leased SF: 9.9M SF
   - Target Accuracy: 97%+
   
   Power BI v2.0 Results:
   - Current Monthly Rent: $______M (target: within 3% of $5.11M)
   - Current Leased SF: ______M SF (target: within 2% of 9.9M)
   - Accuracy Score: ______% (target: 97%+)
   ```

2. **Critical Measure Validation**
   ```
   For each of the 9 measures:
   1. Run measure with test date filter (June 30, 2025)
   2. Compare result to Python baseline
   3. Calculate accuracy percentage
   4. Document results in validation spreadsheet
   
   Acceptance Criteria:
   - Individual measure accuracy: ≥95%
   - Overall accuracy improvement: +10% vs v1.0
   ```

3. **Edge Case Testing**
   ```
   Test Scenarios Directory: /Documentation/Validation/Edge_Case_Test_Data/
   
   Execute test scenarios:
   ✅ Date boundary conditions (month/quarter end)
   ✅ Amendment sequence edge cases
   ✅ Status transition scenarios
   ✅ Zero rent/SF scenarios
   ✅ Termination and renewal combinations
   
   Expected Results File: validation_expected_results.csv
   ```

### Step 3.2: Business Logic Validation
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Owner:** Business Analyst  

1. **Rent Roll Validation**
   ```sql
   -- Validate rent roll totals match expectations
   SELECT 
       SUM([Current Monthly Rent]) as Total_Monthly_Rent,
       SUM([Current Leased SF]) as Total_Leased_SF,
       COUNT(DISTINCT property_id) as Property_Count
   FROM rent_roll_view
   WHERE report_date = '2025-06-30'
   
   Expected vs Actual Comparison:
   - Monthly Rent: Expected $5.11M, Actual $_____M, Variance: ____%
   - Leased SF: Expected 9.9M, Actual _____M, Variance: ____%
   ```

2. **Leasing Activity Validation**
   ```sql
   -- Validate leasing activity calculations
   SELECT
       [New Leases Count],
       [New Leases SF], 
       [Renewals Count],
       [Renewals SF],
       [Net Leasing Activity SF]
   FROM leasing_activity_view
   WHERE period = 'Q2 2025'
   
   Business Logic Checks:
   ✅ New Leases Count > 0
   ✅ Renewals Count > 0  
   ✅ Net Activity = (New + Renewals) - Terminations
   ✅ SF calculations align with count calculations
   ```

3. **WALT Validation**
   ```sql
   -- Validate WALT calculation logic
   SELECT
       [WALT (Months)],
       [Leases Expiring (Next 12 Months)],
       [Expiring Lease SF (Next 12 Months)]
   
   Reasonableness Checks:
   ✅ WALT between 12-120 months (reasonable range)
   ✅ Expiring leases > 0
   ✅ Expiring SF > 0
   ✅ WALT weighted properly by square footage
   ```
