# Harmonization Summary - Yardi PowerBI Project
## Date: 2025-08-09

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete harmonization of the Yardi PowerBI project, resolving all conflicts and ensuring consistency across Power Query scripts, DAX measures, documentation, and SQL validation queries.

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Column Naming Inconsistencies ✅
**Issue**: Mismatch between CSV column names, documentation references, and DAX/SQL queries.

**Resolution**:
- CSV files use spaces: `"property id"`, `"hmy property"`, `"acq. date"`
- DAX measures use brackets with spaces: `[property id]`, `[hmy property]`
- Power Query preserves original names during import, can rename after relationships are established
- SQL queries updated to use brackets for columns with spaces: `[property id]`

### 2. Relationship Mapping Correction ✅
**Issue**: Documentation incorrectly stated join on `property_hmy = property_hmy`, but dim_property doesn't have a `property hmy` column.

**Critical Finding**: The `hmy property` column in dim_fp_buildingcustomdata actually contains property IDs, not HMY values.

**Resolution**:
- Correct relationship: `dim_property[property id] = dim_fp_buildingcustomdata[hmy property]`
- Cardinality: One-to-One (1:1)
- Filter Direction: Single
- All documentation updated to reflect this

### 3. DAX Measure Conflicts ✅
**Issue**: New fund/market measures conflicted with existing production measures.

**Resolution**:
- Renamed base measures:
  - `Total Properties` → `Total Properties Count`
  - `Active Properties` → `Active Properties Count`
- Added % suffix to occupancy measures:
  - `Physical Occupancy by Fund` → `Physical Occupancy by Fund %`
  - `Physical Occupancy by Market` → `Physical Occupancy by Market %`
- Referenced existing measures instead of recreating:
  - Used `[NOI (Net Operating Income)]` in fund/market calculations
  - Used `[Physical Occupancy %]` as base for filtered versions

### 4. USERELATIONSHIP Corrections ✅
**Issue**: New DAX measures used incorrect column references in USERELATIONSHIP functions.

**Resolution**:
- Updated all USERELATIONSHIP calls to:
  ```dax
  USERELATIONSHIP(dim_property[property id], dim_fp_buildingcustomdata[hmy property])
  ```
- Ensured consistency across all 40+ new measures

## Files Modified

### Power Query Scripts
1. **PowerQuery_Fund_Market_Setup.pq**
   - Fixed column references to match CSV headers
   - Corrected join logic: `property id` = `hmy property`
   - Preserved original column names with spaces

### DAX Measures
2. **DAX_Fund_Market_Measures.dax**
   - Resolved naming conflicts with production measures
   - Updated all USERELATIONSHIP references
   - Added proper column references with spaces

3. **Complete_DAX_Library_v5_Harmonized.dax** (NEW)
   - Integrated all v4.0 production measures
   - Added 40+ new fund/market/region measures
   - Fully harmonized and conflict-free

### Documentation
4. **Implementation_Summary_Fund_Market_Filtering.md**
   - Updated relationship specifications
   - Corrected column references
   - Added clarification notes

5. **Dashboard_Slicer_Configuration_Guide.md**
   - Maintains correct field references
   - Properly documents hierarchy setup

### SQL Validation
6. **Validation_Queries_Fund_Market.sql**
   - Updated all joins to use correct columns
   - Added brackets for columns with spaces
   - Fixed property ID references

## Column Naming Convention

### Standard Adopted:
```
CSV Files (Source):     Spaces in names     →  "property id", "hmy property"
Power Query (Import):   Preserve spaces      →  "property id", "hmy property"  
Power BI (Model):       Spaces with brackets →  [property id], [hmy property]
SQL Queries:            Brackets for spaces  →  [property id], [hmy property]
Documentation:          Match Power BI       →  [property id], [hmy property]
```

### Rationale:
- Preserves data integrity during import
- Follows Power BI best practices
- Maintains readability in DAX formulas
- Ensures SQL compatibility

## Critical Relationship Mapping

### Correct Relationship Structure:
```
dim_property                    dim_fp_buildingcustomdata
------------                    -------------------------
[property id] ←───(1:1)───→    [hmy property]
                                (contains property IDs, not HMY)
                                
                                Additional fields:
                                - fund
                                - market  
                                - status
                                - acq. date
                                - disposition date
```

## Implementation Order

For new implementations, follow this sequence:

1. **Import Data**
   - Use updated Power Query scripts
   - Preserve column names with spaces

2. **Create Relationships**
   - dim_property[property id] → dim_fp_buildingcustomdata[hmy property]
   - Set as One-to-One, Single direction

3. **Import DAX Measures**
   - Use Complete_DAX_Library_v5_Harmonized.dax
   - Contains all production + new measures

4. **Configure Slicers**
   - Fund: dim_fund[fund]
   - Market: dim_market_region[market]
   - Region: dim_market_region[region]

5. **Validate**
   - Run SQL validation queries
   - Test filter combinations
   - Verify measure calculations

## Benefits of Harmonization

1. **Consistency**: All components use the same column references
2. **Maintainability**: Clear naming conventions documented
3. **Compatibility**: Works with existing production measures
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new fund/market analyses
5. **Performance**: Optimized relationships and measures
6. **Accuracy**: Correct data model relationships

## Known Limitations

1. The `hmy property` column name is misleading (contains IDs, not HMY values)
2. Some properties may not have building custom data records
3. Fund/market values may have trailing spaces (handled in Power Query)

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider renaming `hmy property` to `property_id_link` for clarity
2. Add data quality checks for fund/market completeness
3. Implement fund vintage year analysis
4. Create submarket definitions
5. Add investment strategy classifications

## Version Control

- **Version 5.0**: Full harmonization with fund/market/region filtering
- **Version 4.0**: Production baseline (preserved)
- All changes are backwards compatible
- No breaking changes to existing dashboards
