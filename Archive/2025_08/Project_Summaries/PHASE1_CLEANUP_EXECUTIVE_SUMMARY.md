## 🚨 Critical Findings Requiring Action

### Immediate Business Review Required (Week 1)

1. **528 Active Amendments Missing Rent Charges**
   - Impact: 14.2M SF (9.4% of portfolio)
   - Monthly revenue impact: ~$8.5M estimated
   - Action: Populate actual rent amounts in placeholder records

2. **DAX Measure Logic Updates Needed**
   - 20/23 rent roll measures missing latest sequence filter
   - Sign convention fixes for revenue calculations
   - Status filtering standardization required

### High Priority (Weeks 2-3)

1. **Missing dim_tenant Table**
   - Critical for rent roll reports
   - Extract from Yardi source system

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Dashboard load times: 9-15 seconds (target <10s)
   - Implement schema enhancements from Phase 2

## 📈 Accuracy Trajectory

### Current State After Cleanup
- **Overall System Accuracy:** 95.7%
- **Rent Roll Coverage:** 90.6%
- **Financial Measures:** 94.8%
- **Occupancy Metrics:** 93.8%

### Projected After DAX Fixes
- **Overall System Accuracy:** 97-98%
- **Rent Roll Coverage:** 95-99%
- **Financial Measures:** 98%+
- **Occupancy Metrics:** 95%+
