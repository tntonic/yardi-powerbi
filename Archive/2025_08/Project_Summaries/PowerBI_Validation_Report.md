- **Data Quality:** Excellent

## 3. Data Integrity Issues ⚠️

### Critical Finding: Orphaned Property Records
- **Issue:** 20.92% of fact_total records reference non-existent properties
- **Impact:** High - Affects financial reporting accuracy
- **Records Affected:** ~2,092 out of 10,000 sampled
- **Recommendation:** Urgent - Reconcile property dimension with fact table

### Amendment Table Issues:
- **Multiple Active Amendments:** 180 property/tenant combinations (13.8%)
- **Sequence Logic Issues:** 1 combination with improper sequencing
- **Duplicate Records:** 1 duplicate property/tenant/sequence combination
- **Impact:** Medium - May cause rent roll inaccuracies

### Orphaned Charge Records:
- **Issue:** 17 rent charges without corresponding amendments
- **Impact:** Low - Only 0.25% of total charges
- **Amount at Risk:** Estimated <$100K monthly

## 4. Business Logic Verification ✓

### Revenue Sign Convention: VERIFIED
- Revenue accounts (4xxxx) correctly stored as negative
- 92% of revenue records follow convention
- 8% positive values require investigation

### Account Code Ranges: VERIFIED
- Revenue: 40000000-49999999 ✓
- Expenses: 50000000-59999999 ✓
- Account types properly classified

### Date Dimension Coverage: EXCEEDS REQUIREMENTS
- Coverage: 2017-2065 (49 years)
- Required: 2020-2025
- Total Records: 17,897

## 5. DAX Measure Validation ⚠️

### Current Monthly Rent Calculation
- **Total Calculated:** $97,773,986
- **Logic:** Correctly filters for "Activated" status and "rent" charge code
- **Issue:** May include terminated leases if end date not considered
- **Recommendation:** Add date filtering to exclude expired amendments

### Key Measure Review:
1. **Total Revenue:** Correctly applies -1 multiplier for sign convention ✓
2. **NOI Calculation:** Properly excludes corporate overhead accounts ✓
3. **Occupancy Calculations:** Logic appears sound ✓
4. **Amendment Filtering:** Includes both "Activated" AND "Superseded" ✓

## 6. Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### Priority 1 - Data Reconciliation
1. **Orphaned Properties (20.92%)**
   - Action: Reconcile dim_property with source system
   - Timeline: Immediate
   - Impact: Financial reporting accuracy

2. **Multiple Active Amendments (180 cases)**
   - Action: Implement latest amendment selection logic
   - Timeline: Within 1 week
   - Impact: Rent roll accuracy

### Priority 2 - Data Quality
1. **Missing Tables (3)**
   - Action: Identify and import missing tables
   - Timeline: Within 2 weeks
   - Impact: Advanced analytics features

2. **Positive Revenue Values (8%)**
   - Action: Investigate and correct sign convention
   - Timeline: Within 1 week
   - Impact: Revenue reporting accuracy

### Priority 3 - Enhancement

## 7. Recommendations for Target Accuracy

To achieve 95-99% rent roll accuracy:
1. Fix orphaned property records
2. Implement proper latest amendment selection
3. Add date range validation to rent calculations
4. Create data quality monitoring dashboard

To achieve 95-98% leasing activity accuracy:
1. Validate amendment type classifications
2. Ensure proper handling of renewals vs new leases
3. Implement square footage validation rules
4. Add tenant industry data completeness checks
