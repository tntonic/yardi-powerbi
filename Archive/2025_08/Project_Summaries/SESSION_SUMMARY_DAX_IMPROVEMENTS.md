# Session Summary: DAX Measures Improvement Project

## Date: August 9, 2024
## Session Objective: Improve DAX measures to recreate rent roll with 95%+ accuracy

## Work Completed This Session

### 1. Rent Roll Validation Process
- ‚úÖ Created Python scripts to generate rent roll from Yardi tables
- ‚úÖ Achieved **95.8% accuracy** compared to native Yardi exports
- ‚úÖ Validated logic for June 30, 2025 (Fund 2 properties)
- ‚úÖ Compared June 1 vs June 30 - found identical results (no mid-month changes)

### 2. Critical Discoveries

#### Column Naming Convention (CRITICAL)
**All Yardi tables use spaces in column names, NOT underscores:**
```
‚úÖ CORRECT:           ‚ùå INCORRECT:
'property hmy'        'property_hmy'
'tenant hmy'         'tenant_hmy'
'tenant id'          'tenant_id'
'amendment status'   'amendment_status'
'amendment type'     'amendment_type'
'amendment sequence' 'amendment_sequence'
'amendment sf'       'amendment_sf'
'from date'          'from_date'
'to date'            'to_date'
'monthly amount'     'monthly_amount'
'charge code'        'charge_code'
```

#### Amendment Status Requirements
- **Must include BOTH**: "Activated" AND "Superseded"
- **Discovery**: 16.7% of active leases have "Superseded" as latest status
- **Impact**: Excluding "Superseded" causes ~14% underreporting

#### Amendment Sequence Logic
- **Critical**: Always select MAX(amendment sequence) per property/tenant
- **Pattern**: Group by property_hmy + tenant_hmy, select max sequence

### 3. Files Created/Updated

#### New Scripts
- `generate_rent_roll_for_date.py` - Flexible date-based generator
- `validate_rent_roll.py` - Validation against Yardi export
- `filter_fund2_data.py` - Data extraction for Fund 2

#### Documentation Updated
- `Rent_Roll_Logic_Complete.md` - Added column naming section
- `IMPLEMENTATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Complete reference guide
- `RENT_ROLL_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Updated with discoveries

#### Archived
- June 1, 2025 analysis files moved to `/Archive/June1_Analysis/`

## Next Steps Required: DAX Measure Updates

### 1. Rent Roll Measures (15+ measures need fixes)
**Current Issue**: Missing MAX(amendment sequence) filter

**Required Fix**:
```dax
// Add to all rent roll measures:
FILTER(
    ALL(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant),
    dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence] = 
    CALCULATE(
        MAX(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence]),
        ALLEXCEPT(
            dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant,
            dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy],
            dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy]
        )
    )
)
```

**Measures to Update**:
- Current Monthly Rent
- Current Annual Rent  
- Current Rent Roll PSF
- Current Leased SF
- WALT (Months)
- Leases Expiring measures
- All rent-related calculations

### 2. Leasing Activity Measures (15+ measures)
**Current Issue**: Only includes "Activated" status

**Required Fix**:
```dax
// Change from:
[amendment status] = "Activated"

// To:
[amendment status] IN {"Activated", "Superseded"}
```

**Measures to Update**:
- New Leases Count/SF
- Renewals Count/SF
- Terminations Count/SF
- Net Leasing Activity
- Retention Rate %
- Leasing Velocity

### 3. Financial Measures
**Current Issue**: Revenue sign convention

**Required Fix**:
```dax
// For revenue accounts (4xxxx):
SUM(fact_total[amount]) * -1
```

## Validation Results Summary

| Metric | Generated | Yardi Export | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Record Count | 268 | 280 | 95.7% |
| Monthly Rent | $5.11M | $5.34M | 95.6% |
| Annual Rent | $61.3M | $64.1M | 95.6% |
| Square Feet | 9.9M | 10.2M | 97.2% |
| **Overall** | - | - | **95.8%** |

## Key Insights for Implementation

1. **Column Names**: PowerBI already uses correct names with spaces
2. **Status Filter**: Including "Superseded" is critical for accuracy
3. **Sequence Logic**: MAX(sequence) per property/tenant is essential
4. **Date Handling**: Excel serial dates in charge schedules need conversion

## Notes for Continuation

When resuming:
1. Start by reviewing this summary
2. Open the Complete_DAX_Library_Production_Ready.dax file
3. Systematically update each measure category
4. Test with Fund 2 data for validation
5. Target: Achieve 97% overall accuracy (from current 85%)
