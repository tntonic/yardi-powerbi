- **Total Charge Schedules:** 19,371
- **Duplicate Active Amendments:** 180 property/tenant combinations
- **Amendments Missing Charges:** 687 (with SF > 0)
- **Invalid Date Sequences:** 10 amendments
- **Orphaned Charge Schedules:** 32 records

### After Cleanup
- **Total Amendments:** 2,472 (unchanged)
- **Active Amendments:** 1,304 (properly deduplicated)
- **Total Charge Schedules:** 19,339 (32 orphaned records removed)
- **Duplicate Active Amendments:** 0 ✅ RESOLVED
- **Invalid Date Sequences:** 0 ✅ RESOLVED
- **Orphaned Charge Schedules:** 0 ✅ RESOLVED

## Actions Taken

### 1. Safety Backups Created ✅
**Location:** `/Users/michaeltang/Documents/GitHub/BI/PBI v1.7/Data/Yardi_Tables/backups_20250809_033315/`
- `dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant_backup.csv` - Original amendments table
- `dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule_backup.csv` - Original charge schedules table

### 2. Duplicate Amendment Resolution ✅
**Action:** Superseded 216 duplicate active amendments
**Method:** Kept highest sequence number per property/tenant combination, superseded older versions
**Audit Trail:** Added cleanup notes to amended records with timestamp and reason

**Sample Properties Affected:**
- Property 904, Tenant 698: 1 duplicate superseded
- Property 1383, Tenant 1306: 2 duplicates superseded
- Property 3643, Tenant 49602: 3 duplicates superseded
- Property 3739, Tenant 17841: 3 duplicates superseded

### 3. Orphaned Records Cleanup ✅
**Action:** Removed 32 orphaned charge schedule records
**Reason:** Charge schedules without corresponding amendment records
**Audit Trail:** Full log saved to `orphaned_charges_log.csv`

**Note:** Initial estimate of "164K orphaned records" was incorrect - actual count was 32 records.

### 4. Date Integrity Fixes ✅
**Action:** Fixed 10 invalid date sequences
**Method:** Cleared end dates that were before start dates
**Audit Trail:** Added cleanup notes with timestamp and reason

### 5. Missing Charges Analysis ✅
**Total Amendments Missing Charges:** 736 amendments

**Breakdown by Priority:**
- **RENT_EXPECTED (CRITICAL):** 528 amendments - 14,221,585 SF
  - Active amendments with square footage but no rent charges
  - Requires immediate business review and rent amount population
  
- **HISTORICAL_RENT (HIGH):** 168 amendments - 6,313,312 SF
  - Superseded amendments missing historical rent data
  - Important for trend analysis and historical reporting
  
- **REVIEW_REQUIRED (MEDIUM):** 27 amendments - 15,477 SF
  - Edge cases requiring business logic validation
  
- **TERMINATION_OK (OK):** 13 amendments - 0 SF
  - Terminated leases appropriately have no charges

## Data Quality Improvements

### Rent Roll Accuracy Impact
- **Eliminated duplicate tenants** in rent roll calculations
- **Removed orphaned data** that could cause calculation errors
- **Fixed date logic** that could cause incorrect lease term calculations
- **Identified missing charges** that need business review

### PowerBI Performance Impact
- **Reduced data volume** by removing 32 orphaned records
- **Improved data consistency** by resolving duplicate active statuses
- **Enhanced calculation accuracy** through cleaner amendment hierarchy

## Files Created

### Cleaned Data Files
- `dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant_cleaned.csv` - Cleaned amendments table
- `dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule_cleaned.csv` - Cleaned charge schedules table

### Audit and Review Files
- `missing_charges_business_review.csv` - Detailed analysis of amendments missing charges
- `orphaned_charges_log.csv` - Complete log of removed orphaned records
- Original backup files for rollback if needed

## Business Review Required

### Critical Actions Needed
1. **Review 528 RENT_EXPECTED amendments** - Active leases missing rent charges
   - Total affected: 14.2M SF
   - Properties span multiple states and portfolios
   - Requires rent amount population from lease documents

2. **Review 168 HISTORICAL_RENT amendments** - Historical data gaps
   - Total affected: 6.3M SF
   - May impact trend analysis and comparative reporting

### Next Steps
1. **Business team review** of missing charges report
2. **Populate missing rent amounts** for critical amendments
3. **Validate PowerBI calculations** with cleaned data
4. **Update DAX measures** if needed based on cleaner data structure
5. **Implement data validation framework** to prevent future issues

## Validation Results

All cleanup operations validated successfully:
- ✅ **Duplicate Active Amendments:** 0 remaining (was 180)
- ✅ **Invalid Date Sequences:** 0 remaining (was 10)
- ✅ **Orphaned Charge Schedules:** 0 remaining (was 32)

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Capability
Complete backups available at: `/Users/michaeltang/Documents/GitHub/BI/PBI v1.7/Data/Yardi_Tables/backups_20250809_033315/`

### Data Integrity
- All changes logged with timestamps and reasons
- No data permanently lost - only status changes and orphaned record removal
- Audit trail maintained for all modifications

## Impact on PowerBI Implementation

### Expected Improvements
1. **Rent Roll Accuracy:** Elimination of duplicate active amendments should resolve double-counting issues
2. **Performance:** Cleaner data structure should improve query performance
3. **Reliability:** Removal of orphaned data reduces calculation errors
4. **Consistency:** Fixed date logic ensures proper lease term calculations

### DAX Measure Updates Recommended
- Review amendment-based rent roll measures for impact of superseded duplicates
- Validate current rent calculations with cleaned active amendment status
- Test leasing activity measures with cleaner date logic

## Conclusion

Data cleanup execution completed successfully with zero data loss and comprehensive audit trails. Critical data quality issues resolved, with remaining items requiring business review for missing charge population. The cleaned dataset is now ready for enhanced PowerBI implementation with improved accuracy and performance.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY  
**Next Phase:** Business review and missing charges population
