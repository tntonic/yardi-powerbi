# Yardi Power BI Data Model Integrity Validation Summary

**Date:** 2025-08-09  
**Validation Scope:** Pre-cleanup baseline assessment  
**Data Model Version:** PBI v1.7  
**Total Records Analyzed:** 1,266,394

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Overall Integrity Score: 75.9/100 (Grade: C - Needs Improvement)**

The Yardi Power BI data model validation reveals significant structural and data integrity issues that must be resolved before DAX implementation and dashboard deployment. While core tables are present and amendment logic is sound, critical relationship integrity problems and missing data threaten reporting accuracy.

## ‚ùå Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### 1. Massive Orphaned Records Problem (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** 32.52% of fact_total records reference non-existent properties  
**Root Cause:** ETL process including inactive/deleted properties in fact extraction  
**Financial Impact:** $822 million in orphaned transactions  
**DAX Impact:** Will cause NULL values and incorrect totals in all property-level measures

**Top Affected Properties:**
- Property ID 2828: 3,177 orphaned records
- Property ID 2829: 2,776 orphaned records  
- Property ID 1604: 2,699 orphaned records
- Property ID 3599: 2,310 orphaned records
- Property ID 1606: 2,219 orphaned records

### 2. Key Column Relationship Mismatch (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Amendment table uses "property hmy" while property table uses "property id"  
**Root Cause:** Inconsistent key naming conventions across tables  
**Impact:** Prevents proper relationship establishment in Power BI  
**Solution Required:** Standardize primary/foreign key naming or create mapping

### 3. Missing Rent Charges (HIGH)
**Issue:** 735 active amendments (29.75%) have no associated rent charges  
**Impact:** Rent roll calculations will be incomplete and under-reported  
**Business Risk:** Financial reporting accuracy compromised

### 4. Missing Core Tables (HIGH)
**Critical Missing Tables:**
- `dim_tenant` - **BREAKS RENT ROLL COMPLETELY**
- `fact_leasingactivity` - Prevents leasing metrics
- `fact_marketrentsurvey` - Limits market analysis
- `dim_assetstatus` - Property classification incomplete

---

## ‚úÖ Positive Findings

### Amendment Logic Integrity (Perfect Score)
- **No duplicate latest amendments** - Critical for rent roll accuracy
- **Proper sequence logic** - 1,304 unique property/tenant combinations
- **Clean status distribution** - 1,520 Activated, 951 Superseded, 1 In Process
- **Latest amendment filtering** works correctly

### Core Data Volume (Healthy)
- **fact_total:** 506,367 records - Financial data substantial
- **fact_occupancyrentarea:** 601,319 records - Occupancy tracking robust  
- **Amendment records:** 2,471 active amendments - Lease data comprehensive
- **Charge schedule:** 19,371 records - Rent charge data extensive

### Account Relationships (Perfect)
- **0% orphaned account records** - Chart of accounts mapping intact
- **Complete GL integration** - Account hierarchy preserved
- **Revenue/expense categorization** - Account type logic functional

## üîß Prioritized Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (Week 1)
1. **Resolve Orphaned Records**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM fact_total 
   WHERE [property id] NOT IN (SELECT [property id] FROM dim_property);
   ```
   Expected removal: 164,646 records

2. **Standardize Key Relationships**
   - Map property_hmy to property_id across tables
   - Create relationship bridge table if needed
   - Validate all foreign key relationships

3. **Extract Missing dim_tenant Table**
   - Critical for rent roll functionality
   - Must include tenant_hmy mapping to amendments

### Phase 2: Core Completeness (Week 2-3)
1. **Add Critical Fact Tables**
   - Extract `fact_leasingactivity` from Yardi
   - Add `fact_marketrentsurvey` for market analysis
   
2. **Complete Dimension Tables**
   - Add `dim_assetstatus` for property classification
   - Extract reason code dimensions for leasing analysis

3. **Populate Missing Charges**
   - Investigate 735 amendments without charges
   - Extract missing charge schedule data
   - Implement charge creation validation

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Monitoring (Week 4+)
1. **Add Specialized Tables**
   - Bridge tables for complex relationships
   - Reference tables for business logic
   - External data for market projections

2. **Implement Data Quality Controls**
   - Automated orphan record detection
   - Referential integrity constraints
   - Regular validation reporting

## üìù SQL Validation Queries

### Critical Issues Detection
```sql
-- 1. Find all orphaned fact_total records
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_count,
       SUM([amount]) as orphaned_amount
FROM fact_total f
LEFT JOIN dim_property p ON f.[property id] = p.[property id]  
WHERE p.[property id] IS NULL;

-- 2. Identify amendments without charges
SELECT COUNT(*) as missing_charges_count
FROM dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant a
LEFT JOIN dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule c ON a.[amendment hmy] = c.[amendment hmy]
WHERE a.[amendment status] IN ('Activated', 'Superseded')
  AND c.[amendment hmy] IS NULL;

-- 3. Check for duplicate latest amendments  
SELECT [property hmy], [tenant hmy], COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM (
    SELECT [property hmy], [tenant hmy], [amendment sequence],
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY [property hmy], [tenant hmy]
