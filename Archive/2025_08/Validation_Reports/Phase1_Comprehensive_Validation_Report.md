- **Improper Status Filtering**: 22/23 measures (96%)
- **Missing Charge Integration**: 7/23 measures (30%)

**Data Consistency Issues:**
- **Amendment Charge Coverage**: Only 27.9% (Target: 90%+)
- **Duplicate Latest Amendments**: 0 (Good)
- **Proposal Amendments to Exclude**: 94

**Business Impact**: Amendment logic failures explain the low rent roll accuracy and directly impact the $232K monthly calculation gap identified in Fund 2 analysis.

### ‚ùå Accuracy Testing - FAIL (66.3%)
**Accuracy Validation Results from Enhanced Test Suite:**

**Overall Status**: FAIL  
**Overall Accuracy**: 66.3% (Target: 95%+)  
**Test Summary**: 3 passed, 10 failed, 1 warning out of 14 tests

**Key Accuracy Failures:**
1. **Rent Roll Accuracy Tests**: Failed for both March 2025 and December 2024 comparison dates
2. **Amendment Selection Logic**: 58% accuracy (Target: 90%+)
3. **Business Rule Implementation**: Critical failures in "latest amendment WITH charges" logic

**Root Cause**: Amendment logic failures cascade into accuracy failures, confirming that DAX measure fixes are the primary requirement for accuracy improvement.

## üö® Critical Issues Summary

### Priority 1 - Immediate Action Required (Days 1-3)

#### 1. Amendment Logic Implementation
**Issue**: 20/23 rent roll measures missing latest sequence filter  
**Impact**: Direct cause of $232K monthly calculation gap  
**Fix Required**: Add MAX(amendment sequence) per property/tenant to all rent measures
```dax
// Required Logic Pattern:
FILTER(
    ALL(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant),
    dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence] = 
    CALCULATE(
        MAX(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence]),
        ALLEXCEPT(
            dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant,
            dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy],
            dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy]
        )
    )
)
```

#### 2. Financial Sign Convention Fixes  
**Issue**: Revenue and expense measures not implementing proper sign conventions  
**Impact**: Financial reporting will show incorrect values  
**Fix Required**: 
- Total Revenue: Add `* -1` multiplier
- Operating Expenses: Add `ABS()` function
- NOI Margin %: Replace division with `DIVIDE()`

#### 3. Status Filtering Standardization
**Issue**: 22/23 measures using "Activated" only instead of {"Activated", "Superseded"}  
**Impact**: 5-8% undercounting in leasing metrics  
**Fix Required**: Update all measures to include both statuses

### Priority 2 - Data Quality Improvements (Days 4-7)

#### 1. Charge Schedule Integration
**Current**: 27.9% charge coverage rate  
**Target**: 90%+ coverage  
**Action**: Implement "latest amendment WITH charges" business rule

#### 2. Data Integrity Resolution
**Issue**: Multiple data integrity test failures  
**Action**: Address orphaned records, missing references, invalid date ranges

### Priority 3 - Performance Optimization (Days 8-14)

#### 1. Dashboard Load Time Optimization
**Current**: 9-15s load times  
**Target**: <6-10s depending on dashboard complexity  
**Actions**: 
- Implement aggregation tables
- Optimize iterator-heavy calculations
- Consider incremental refresh strategies
