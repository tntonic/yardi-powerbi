## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Amendment-Based Data Integration

**Issue**: Several measures showing $0 or 0 values due to missing column mappings:
- `charge code type` not found in charge schedule data
- `rentable area` not found in amendment data

**Impact**: 
- Current Monthly Rent calculation failed
- Current Leased SF calculation failed
- WALT calculation incomplete

**Recommendation**: 
- Verify column naming in amendment and charge tables
- Update data model to include proper amendment-based area calculations
- Test alternative column names (`charge_code_type`, `rentable_area_sf`, etc.)

### 2. Revenue Sign Convention Issues

**Issue**: Total Revenue showing 95.3% accuracy with $176M variance

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Revenue accounts (4xxxx) stored as negative in GL
- DAX measure may not be applying multiply by -1 correctly
- Account filtering may be excluding valid revenue accounts

**Recommendation**:
```dax
Total Revenue = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(fact_total[amount]) * -1,  // Ensure sign correction
    dim_account[account code] >= 40000000,
    dim_account[account code] < 50000000,
    fact_total[amount type] = "Actual",
    dim_book[book] = "Accrual"
)
```

### 3. Occupancy Calculation Precision

**Issue**: Physical Occupancy showing 92.8% accuracy (2.2% below target)

**Root Cause**: Variance in occupied/rentable area ratio calculation

**Recommendation**:
- Validate occupancy data filtering by report date
- Check for data quality issues in area calculations
- Ensure consistent area units (SF vs other measurements)

---

## Priority Fix Recommendations

### Immediate (Week 1)

1. **Fix Amendment Data Integration** (Highest Priority)
   - Map correct column names for charges and area data
   - Test amendment-based rent and SF calculations
   - Expected improvement: +$5M+ monthly rent capture

2. **Correct Revenue Sign Convention**
   - Validate multiply by -1 in Total Revenue measure
   - Test against GL source data
   - Expected improvement: Revenue accuracy to 98%+

3. **Refine Occupancy Calculations**
   - Validate area aggregation logic
   - Check filter context for occupancy measures
   - Expected improvement: Occupancy accuracy to 95%+

### Medium Term (Week 2-3)

4. **Enhance NOI Calculations**
   - Fix cascading issues from revenue corrections
   - Validate expense account filtering
   - Expected improvement: NOI accuracy to 98%+

5. **Validate Area Calculations**
   - Address large variances in vacant area calculations
   - Ensure consistent area measurement units
   - Expected improvement: Area accuracy to 97%+
