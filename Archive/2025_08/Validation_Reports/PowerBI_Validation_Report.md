### Date Dimension Coverage: EXCEEDS REQUIREMENTS
- Coverage: 2017-2065 (49 years)
- Required: 2020-2025
- Total Records: 17,897

## 5. DAX Measure Validation ⚠️

### Current Monthly Rent Calculation
- **Total Calculated:** $97,773,986
- **Logic:** Correctly filters for "Activated" status and "rent" charge code
- **Issue:** May include terminated leases if end date not considered
- **Recommendation:** Add date filtering to exclude expired amendments

### Key Measure Review:
1. **Total Revenue:** Correctly applies -1 multiplier for sign convention ✓
2. **NOI Calculation:** Properly excludes corporate overhead accounts ✓
3. **Occupancy Calculations:** Logic appears sound ✓
4. **Amendment Filtering:** Includes both "Activated" AND "Superseded" ✓

## 6. Agent Validation Findings (December 2024)

### Completed Resolutions:
1. ✅ **Orphaned Properties** - DELETED (20.92% of fact_total)
2. ✅ **Duplicate Amendments** - DELETED (180 cases)

### Remaining Critical Fixes:

#### Priority 1 - DAX Logic Updates (1-2 days)
