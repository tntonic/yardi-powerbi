### Table Completeness (56.2/100)
- **Expected Tables:** 32
- **Found Tables:** 29 (18 matching expected schema)
- **Missing Tables:** 14 critical tables
- **Coverage:** 56.25% of expected architecture

### Data Integrity Issues
- **Orphaned Records:** 164,646 (32.52% of fact_total records)
- **Missing Rent Charges:** 735 amendments (29.75% of active amendments)

- **Root Cause:** Data extraction/ETL process not properly filtering inactive properties

### 3. Missing Rent Charges (HIGH)
- **735 active amendments without rent charges (29.75%)**
- Affects rent roll accuracy and completeness
- **Impact:** Under-reporting of rental income in Power BI dashboards
- **Root Cause:** Amendments created without corresponding charge schedule entries

## ‚úÖ Positive Findings

### Amendment Integrity (100/100)
- **No duplicate latest amendments** - Excellent data quality
- **2,471 active amendments** properly sequenced
- **1,304 unique property/tenant combinations**
- Amendment sequence logic is working correctly

## üö® Impact Assessment

### High Impact Issues
1. **32.52% orphaned fact_total records** will cause:
   - Incorrect revenue/expense totals in dashboards
   - Broken property-level financial analysis
   - DAX measures returning NULL or wrong values

2. **Missing dim_tenant table** will cause:
   - Rent roll reports to fail completely
   - Tenant analysis dashboards to be non-functional
   - Leasing activity tracking to be impossible

3. **29.75% missing rent charges** will cause:
   - Under-reporting of rental income
   - Incomplete rent roll calculations
   - Inaccurate leasing metrics

### Medium Impact Issues
1. **Missing fact_leasingactivity table** will prevent:
   - New lease, renewal, and termination tracking
   - Leasing velocity analysis
   - Retention rate calculations

2. **Missing dimension tables** will limit:
   - Detailed property categorization
   - Market segment analysis  
   - Comprehensive leasing reason tracking

## üîß Recommended Remediation Steps

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Priority 1 - Immediate)
1. **Resolve orphaned fact_total records**
   ```sql
   -- Identify and remove orphaned records
   DELETE FROM fact_total 
   WHERE [property id] NOT IN (SELECT [property id] FROM dim_property);
   ```

2. **Add missing dim_tenant table**
   - Extract tenant master data from Yardi
   - Ensure proper tenant_hmy linking to amendments

3. **Populate missing rent charges**
   - Identify amendments without charges using validation script
   - Extract missing charge schedule data
   - Link charges to amendment_hmy properly

### Phase 2: Architecture Completion (Priority 2 - Short Term)
1. **Add missing fact tables**
   - `fact_leasingactivity` - Critical for leasing metrics
   - `fact_marketrentsurvey` - Important for market analysis

2. **Add missing dimension tables**
   - `dim_assetstatus`, `dim_marketsegment` - Property classification
   - `dim_moveoutreasons`, `dim_newleasereason`, `dim_renewalreason` - Leasing analysis

### Phase 3: Enhancement Tables (Priority 3 - Long Term)
1. **Add specialized tables**
   - `bridge_propertymarkets` - Property-market relationships
   - `ref_book_override_logic` - Advanced book logic
   - `external_market_growth_projections` - Forecasting support

## üìù Validation Queries for Cleanup

### Identify Orphaned Properties
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.[property id] 
FROM fact_total f
LEFT JOIN dim_property p ON f.[property id] = p.[property id]
WHERE p.[property id] IS NULL
ORDER BY f.[property id];
```

### Find Amendments Without Charges
```sql
SELECT a.[amendment hmy], a.[property hmy], a.[tenant hmy], a.[amendment status]
FROM dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant a
LEFT JOIN dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule c ON a.[amendment hmy] = c.[amendment hmy]
WHERE a.[amendment status] IN ('Activated', 'Superseded')
  AND c.[amendment hmy] IS NULL;
```

### Validate Amendment Sequences
```sql
SELECT [property hmy], [tenant hmy], 
       COUNT(*) as amendment_count,
       MAX([amendment sequence]) as latest_sequence
FROM dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant
WHERE [amendment status] IN ('Activated', 'Superseded')
GROUP BY [property hmy], [tenant hmy]
ORDER BY amendment_count DESC;
```

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Data Cleanup** - Address orphaned records and missing charges
2. **Missing Table Extraction** - Focus on dim_tenant and fact_leasingactivity
3. **ETL Process Review** - Ensure proper data extraction from Yardi

### Pre-DAX Implementation Checklist
