 # Power BI Dashboard Reference Library for Claude.ai

## üéØ Purpose

This is a curated reference library designed specifically for teams building Power BI dashboards with assistance from Claude.ai. The library contains production-ready DAX measures, comprehensive documentation, and validated implementation patterns for commercial real estate analytics using Yardi data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Update: v5.1 Date Handling

**IMPORTANT**: As of v5.1, all DAX measures use the Yardi closed period date dynamically:
- **Old Pattern (v5.0)**: `VAR CurrentDate = TODAY()`
- **New Pattern (v5.1)**: `VAR CurrentDate = CALCULATE(MAX(dim_lastclosedperiod[last closed period]), ALL(dim_lastclosedperiod))`
- **Benefits**: Ensures consistency with Yardi financial reporting periods
- **Automatic Updates**: Date updates when Power BI data is refreshed
- **Required Table**: `dim_lastclosedperiod` must be in your data model

## üìö How to Use with Claude.ai

### Setting Up Your Claude.ai Project

1. **Create a new project** in Claude.ai
2. **Upload this entire Claude_AI_Reference folder** to your project
3. **Reference these materials** when asking Claude questions about:
   - DAX measure creation
   - Dashboard design patterns
   - Data model relationships
   - Troubleshooting common issues
   - Performance optimization

### Best Practices for Asking Claude Questions

#### Effective Question Examples:
‚úÖ "Using the Top 20 measures, create a KPI card for Current Monthly Rent"
‚úÖ "Based on the Executive Dashboard template, how should I structure my filters?"
‚úÖ "The rent roll accuracy is below 95% - what should I check based on Common Issues?"
‚úÖ "How do I implement the amendment-based logic for rent roll calculations?"

#### Include Context:
- Specify which dashboard you're building (Executive, Financial, Leasing, Rent Roll)
- Mention your data source (Yardi tables) and any customizations
- State your accuracy requirements (95-99% for rent roll)
- Describe any error messages or unexpected results

## üîë Key Concepts to Remember

### 1. Amendment-Based Logic
The most critical innovation is using amendment tables for rent roll:
- Filter by **latest sequence** per property/tenant
- Include both **"Activated" AND "Superseded"** status
- This achieves 95-99% accuracy vs native Yardi

### 2. Revenue Sign Convention
- Revenue accounts (4xxxx) are stored as **negative** in GL
- Always **multiply by -1** for display in reports
- Operating expenses (5xxxx) are positive

### 3. Data Model Structure
- **32 optimized tables** in star schema
- **Single-direction relationships** except Calendar (bi-directional)
- **Hybrid approach**: Detail + pre-aggregated summary tables

### 4. Performance Standards
- Dashboard load: < 10 seconds
- Query response: < 5 seconds
- Data refresh: < 30 minutes
- Accuracy: 95-99% for critical metrics

## üí° Quick Reference: Top 5 Most-Used Measures

1. **Total Revenue**: `SUM(fact_total[amount]) * -1` with account filtering
2. **NOI**: `[Total Revenue] - [Operating Expenses]`
3. **Physical Occupancy %**: `[Occupied Area] / [Rentable Area] * 100`
4. **Current Monthly Rent**: Amendment-based with charge schedule lookup
5. **Retention Rate %**: `[Renewals] / ([Renewals] + [Terminations]) * 100`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Always validate** rent roll accuracy before deployment (95%+ required)
2. **Test with multiple periods** to ensure time intelligence works correctly
3. **Check amendment sequences** are properly filtered to latest
4. **Verify revenue signs** are handled correctly (negative to positive)
5. **Monitor performance** during development - refactor if >10 second loads

## üìä Expected Outcomes

When properly implemented, this solution delivers:
- **97-99% accuracy** for rent roll vs native Yardi
- **97-98% accuracy** for leasing activity metrics
- **98%+ accuracy** for financial calculations
- **Real-time dashboards** replacing monthly Excel exports
- **Enhanced analytics** beyond standard Yardi reports
- **Month-to-month lease tracking** with proper identification
