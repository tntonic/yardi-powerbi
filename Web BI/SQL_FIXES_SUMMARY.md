# Yardi PowerBI Dashboard SQL Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-08-11
## Issue: Multiple SQL syntax errors preventing dashboard from loading
## Updated: Fixed additional SQL alias and date conversion errors

## Problems Identified

1. **Property ID Filter Issues**
   - Property IDs were passed as full strings like `"3ca00001 - 605-655 Hawaii Avenue (Torrance, CA)"`
   - These strings were directly inserted into SQL IN clauses without proper parsing
   - Caused SQL syntax errors due to unescaped special characters

2. **Column Name Mismatches**
   - Database uses column names with spaces (e.g., `"last closed period"`)
   - SQL queries incorrectly used underscores (e.g., `last_closed_period`)
   - DuckDB requires exact column name matches with proper quoting

3. **Filter Type Mismatches**
   - `fund_filter` and `book_filter` were single strings from selectbox widgets
   - Code incorrectly treated them as lists and iterated over characters
   - Resulted in malformed SQL like `IN (A,l,l, ,B,o,o,k,s)`

4. **Missing Fund Column**
   - The `fund` column does not exist in the `dim_property` table
   - Fund filtering logic couldn't be implemented without this data

5. **SQL Alias Reference Error**
   - Subquery was using alias `o` before it was defined
   - Error: `o."first day of month"` used inside subquery where `o` wasn't available yet

6. **Date Type Mismatch**
   - `"first day of month"` column stores Excel serial dates (integers)
   - Queries were passing date strings instead of serial numbers
   - Caused conversion errors when filtering by date range

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Property ID Processing (`app.py`)
- Extract only the property code portion from the selected property strings
- Parse strings to get the code before the dash separator
- Pass clean property codes to dashboard components

### 2. Fixed Filter Building (`executive_summary_enhanced.py`)
- Changed property filter to use `"property code"` instead of `"property id"`
- Properly quote property codes in SQL IN clauses
- Handle empty selections gracefully

### 3. Fixed Column Name References
- Changed `last_closed_period` to `"last closed period"` (with quotes)
- Ensured all column references match the actual database schema
- Added proper quoting for columns with spaces

### 4. Fixed Fund and Book Filter Handling
- Parse fund/book filter strings to extract actual values
- Map user-friendly names to database values (e.g., "Book 46 (FPR)" → "46")
- Build proper SQL conditions for single values instead of lists

### 5. Disabled Fund Filtering (Temporary)
- Fund column not available in current data model
- Fund filtering disabled until data model is updated
- Added graceful handling and informative messages

### 6. Fixed SQL Alias Reference (`executive_summary_enhanced.py`)
- Removed alias reference from inside subquery
- Changed `o."first day of month"` to `"first day of month"` in WHERE clause
- Alias `o` now only used after subquery is defined

### 7. Fixed Date Type Conversion (`executive_summary_enhanced.py`)
- Convert Python dates to Excel serial format for filtering
- Formula: `(date - date(1900, 1, 1)).days + 2`
- Applied to all queries filtering on `"first day of month"` column
- Maintains correct date comparison with integer columns

## Files Modified

1. **`/Web BI/app.py`**
   - Added property code extraction logic
   - Added fund/book value parsing
   - Applied to all dashboard choices

2. **`/Web BI/components/executive_summary_enhanced.py`**
   - Fixed property filter building (use property code, not ID)
   - Fixed fund/book filter building (handle single values)
   - Fixed column name references (spaces vs underscores)
   - Disabled fund filtering temporarily

3. **`/Web BI/test_sql_fixes.py`** (Created)
   - Test script to validate all SQL fixes
   - Tests database connection, column names, filters
   - All 5 tests passing

## Test Results

```
✅ Database connection successful
✅ Column name test passed
✅ Property filter test passed
⚠️ Fund filter test skipped (column not available)
✅ Book filter test passed
✅ Complex query test passed
```

## Remaining Issues

1. **Fund Filtering**: Requires adding fund information to the data model
2. **Performance**: Consider adding indexes on frequently filtered columns
3. **Error Handling**: Could be enhanced with more specific error messages

## Recommendations

1. **Data Model Update**: Add fund information to enable fund filtering
2. **Column Naming**: Consider standardizing column names (all spaces or all underscores)
3. **Testing**: Run comprehensive dashboard testing with various filter combinations
4. **Documentation**: Update data dictionary with correct column names

## How to Test

1. Navigate to the Web BI directory
2. Run the test script: `python3 test_sql_fixes.py`
3. Launch the dashboard: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Test various filter combinations in the UI

## Impact

- Dashboard should now load without SQL syntax errors
- Property filtering works correctly
- Book filtering works correctly
- Fund filtering temporarily disabled but handled gracefully
- All column references properly quoted
