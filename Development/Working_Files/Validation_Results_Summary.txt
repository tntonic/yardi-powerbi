RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
==================
IMMEDIATE (Priority 1):
1. Remove 164,646 orphaned fact_total records
2. Extract missing dim_tenant table
3. Standardize property key relationships
4. Populate 735 missing rent charges

SHORT-TERM (Priority 2):
1. Add fact_leasingactivity table
2. Add remaining missing dimension tables  
3. Implement data quality monitoring
4. Re-validate model integrity

TARGET METRICS (Post-Cleanup):
- Integrity Score: 90+ (from 75.9)
- Orphaned Records: <5% (from 32.52%)
- Missing Charges: <10% (from 29.75%)
- Table Completeness: 90%+ (from 56.25%)

VALIDATION STATUS: COMPLETE
NEXT PHASE: Data cleanup and remediation
CRITICAL PATH: Fix orphaned records → Add missing tables → DAX validation
