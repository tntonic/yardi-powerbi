"""
DAX Charge Integration Analysis

This script analyzes the critical issue found in the Current Monthly Rent DAX measure.
The investigation revealed a potential $792K/month ($9.5M annual) difference in rent calculations
due to how the DAX measure handles charge schedule integration with amendment filtering.

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
- 123 orphaned charges ($817K/month)  
- 13.2% difference between latest amendments vs all filtered amendments
- Current DAX logic may not properly constrain charge schedule to latest amendments only

This validates whether the DAX logic is correctly implemented or needs optimization.
