# LEASING ACTIVITY DAX MEASURES - VALIDATION SUMMARY
**Executive Summary for Stakeholder Review**

---

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING: DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION

The newly created Leasing Activity DAX Library v1.0 (75 measures) **DOES NOT MEET** the required 95% accuracy threshold for production deployment. Comprehensive validation against Q4 2024 AM slide expected results shows **critical calculation errors** that must be resolved before business use.

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### üî¥ **ISSUE #1: Fund Classification Logic (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem:** Only 27% of deals correctly classified by fund
- **Impact:** All fund-specific measures produce wrong results
- **Cause:** Placeholder logic using arbitrary deal assignment instead of actual fund mapping

### üî¥ **ISSUE #2: Weighted Rate Calculation (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem:** Rates showing $117K+ instead of $7-10 PSF
- **Impact:** All rate-based measures completely unusable
- **Cause:** Fundamental error in PSF calculation logic - calculating total rent instead of rate per square foot

### üî¥ **ISSUE #3: Deal Type Detection (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem:** Zero "New Lease" deals detected in Q4 2024
- **Impact:** New vs Renewal analysis completely wrong
- **Cause:** Proposal Type filtering logic doesn't match data structure

### üü° **ISSUE #4: Missing Spread Calculations (HIGH)**
- **Problem:** Spread measures use placeholder values only
- **Impact:** Key business metrics (38% over prior, 30% over BP) not available
- **Cause:** Spread logic not implemented in DAX library

## BUSINESS IMPACT

### If These Measures Were Used in Production:

‚ùå **Fund Performance Reports:** Would show wrong leasing activity by 40-60%  
‚ùå **Rate Analysis:** Would show impossible PSF rates (10,000x too high)  
‚ùå **Deal Mix Analysis:** Would show zero new leases (actually 7 new leases in Q4)  
‚ùå **Leasing Spreads:** Would show no spread analysis (critical for AM meetings)  
‚ùå **Executive Dashboards:** Would provide completely misleading business insights  

### **Financial Risk:** HIGH
Using these measures could lead to incorrect investment decisions based on fundamentally flawed data.

## REQUIRED FIXES (Before Production)

### **Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1-2 Days)**

1. **Fix Fund Classification**
   ```dax
   // Replace placeholder with actual fund mapping
   Fund Classification = RELATED(dim_property[Fund])
   ```

2. **Fix Weighted Rate Calculation**
   ```dax
   // Correct PSF calculation
   Weighted Average Rate PSF = 
   DIVIDE(
       SUMX(ValidDeals, [Starting Rent] * [dArea]),
       SUMX(ValidDeals, [dArea])
   )
   ```

3. **Fix Deal Type Detection**
   ```dax
   // Enhanced new lease detection
   New Leases Count = 
   CALCULATE(
       COUNTROWS(ValidDeals),
       [Proposal Type] IN {"New Lease", "New"} ||
       [Cash Flow Type] = "Proposal" && 
       NOT(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(fact_leasingactivity), [Cash Flow Type] = "Prior Lease"))
   )
   ```

### **Phase 2: Complete Implementation (3-5 Days)**

4. **Implement Spread Calculations**
5. **Add Business Plan Rate Integration** 
6. **Enhance Data Quality Measures**
7. **Add Fund-Specific Filtering**

## RECOMMENDATION

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **DO NOT DEPLOY** current DAX library to production
2. **HALT** any dashboard development using these measures
3. **PRIORITIZE** Phase 1 critical fixes immediately
4. **RE-VALIDATE** after each fix is implemented
5. **REQUIRE** 95%+ accuracy before any business use

### **TIMELINE:**
- **Week 1:** Critical fixes (Fund classification, Rate calculations, Deal counts)
- **Week 2:** Feature completion (Spreads, BP rates, Validation)
- **Week 3:** Final validation and production deployment

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
‚úÖ All measures achieve 95%+ accuracy against AM slide expected results  
‚úÖ Complete validation against Q4 2024, Q3 2024, and Q2 2024 data  
‚úÖ Performance benchmarks maintained (<3 seconds per measure)  
‚úÖ Data quality standards maintained (>97%)
