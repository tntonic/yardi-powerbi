# P&L Dynamic Book Selection Architecture - Delivery Summary

## Executive Overview

A comprehensive P&L reporting solution has been designed for the Yardi Power BI system that enables dynamic switching between actuals and forecasts. The architecture supports Book 1 (Accrual) for actuals and 10 BA- books for various forecast scenarios, with sophisticated variance analysis and executive reporting capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow Design
```
fact_total[book_id] → Dynamic Book Selection → P&L Calculations
                   ↓
User Slicer Selection → Book Selection Logic → Financial Measures
                   ↓  
Multiple Book Comparison → Variance Analysis → Executive Reporting
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Single CALCULATE filters for book selection
- Efficient time intelligence patterns
- Pre-calculated variance measures
- Optimized multi-book comparisons

### Business Logic Implementation
- **Revenue Sign Handling**: Properly converts negative GL balances to positive revenue
- **Account Filtering**: 4xxxx for revenue, 5xxxx for expenses
- **Amendment Logic**: Compatible with existing rent roll calculations  
- **Date Intelligence**: Uses `dim_lastclosedperiod` for consistency

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Dynamic Book Selection
- Radio button slicer for mode selection
- Seamless switching between actuals and forecasts
- Custom book selection option
- Visual indicators for selected book type

### 2. Variance Analysis
