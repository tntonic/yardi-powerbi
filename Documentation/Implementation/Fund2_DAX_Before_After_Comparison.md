# Fund 2 DAX Fixes - Before/After Comparison

## Executive Summary

**Project:** Fund 2 Rent Roll Accuracy Critical Issues Resolution  
**Implementation Date:** August 9, 2025  
**Version Upgrade:** v2.0 → v3.0 (Fund 2 Specific Fixes)  
**Target Improvement:** 63% → 95%+ accuracy, eliminate $232K/month gap  

### Critical Issues Addressed
1. **Amendment Selection Logic**: Changed from MAX(sequence) to MAX(sequence WITH charges)
2. **Business Rule Enhancement**: Exclude "Proposal in DM" amendment types  
3. **Charge Integration Optimization**: Replace FILTER(ALL(...)) with CALCULATETABLE patterns
4. **Status Prioritization**: Prioritize "Activated" over "Superseded" when both have charges

---

## 1. Current Monthly Rent - Critical $232K/Month Fix

### Issue Identified
- Latest amendments (MAX sequence) often lack rent charges
- 634 amendments (72%) without rent charges were being selected
- Join success rate only 82.1% between amendments and charges
- "Proposal in DM" types included despite having no charges

### BEFORE (v2.0 - Existing Logic)
```dax
Current Monthly Rent = 
VAR CurrentDate = CALCULATE(
    MAX(dim_lastclosedperiod[last closed period]),
    ALL(dim_lastclosedperiod)
)
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    SUM(dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[monthly amount]),
    FILTER(
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant,
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment status] IN {"Activated", "Superseded"} &&
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment type] <> "Termination" &&
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment start date] <= CurrentDate &&
        (dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment end date] >= CurrentDate || 
         ISBLANK(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment end date]))
    ),
    FILTER(
        ALL(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant),  // ← INEFFICIENT PATTERN
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence] = 
        CALCULATE(
            MAX(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence]),  // ← NO CHARGE VALIDATION
            ALLEXCEPT(
                dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant,
                dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy],
                dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy]
            )
        )
    ),
    dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[from date] <= CurrentDate,
    dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[to date] >= CurrentDate || ISBLANK(dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[to date])
)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Selects MAX(sequence) regardless of whether charges exist
- ❌ FILTER(ALL(...)) creates inefficient context manipulation
- ❌ No validation that selected amendment has active rent charges
- ❌ Includes "Proposal in DM" amendments (no charges)
- ❌ No status prioritization when multiple amendments exist

### AFTER (v3.0 - Fund 2 Fixed Logic)
```dax
Current Monthly Rent = 
VAR CurrentDate = CALCULATE(
    MAX(dim_lastclosedperiod[last closed period]),
    ALL(dim_lastclosedperiod)

// Step 1: Get base amendments with business rule filters
VAR BaseAmendments = 
    CALCULATETABLE(  // ← EFFICIENT PATTERN

        NOT(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment type] IN {"Termination", "Proposal in DM"}),  // ← EXCLUDE PROPOSALS
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment start date] <= CurrentDate,
        (dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment end date] >= CurrentDate || 
         ISBLANK(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment end date]))
    )
// Step 2: Get amendments that have active rent charges (CRITICAL FILTER)
VAR AmendmentsWithCharges = 
    FILTER(
        BaseAmendments,
        CALCULATE(  // ← VALIDATE CHARGES EXIST
            COUNTROWS(dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule),
            dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[amendment hmy] = dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment hmy],
            dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[charge code] = "rent",
            dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[from date] <= CurrentDate,
            (dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[to date] >= CurrentDate || 
             ISBLANK(dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[to date]))
        ) > 0
    )
// Step 3: Get latest amendment WITH charges per property/tenant
VAR LatestAmendmentsWithCharges = 
    SUMMARIZE(  // ← OPTIMIZED PATTERN
        AmendmentsWithCharges,
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy],
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy],
        "MaxSequenceWithCharges", 
        MAX(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence]),  // ← ONLY FROM THOSE WITH CHARGES
        "PreferredStatus",
        // Prioritize Activated over Superseded when both have charges
        IF(
            CALCULATE(
                COUNTROWS(AmendmentsWithCharges),
                dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment status] = "Activated"
            ) > 0,
            "Activated",  // ← STATUS PRIORITIZATION
            "Superseded"
        )
    )
// Step 4: Calculate rent from latest amendments with charges
RETURN
SUMX(
    LatestAmendmentsWithCharges,
    VAR PropertyHmy = [property hmy]
    VAR TenantHmy = [tenant hmy]
    VAR MaxSeq = [MaxSequenceWithCharges]
    VAR PreferredStatus = [PreferredStatus]
    RETURN
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[monthly amount]),
        TREATAS({PropertyHmy}, dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy]),  // ← EFFICIENT FILTERING
        TREATAS({TenantHmy}, dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy]),
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence] = MaxSeq,
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment status] = PreferredStatus,
        dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[charge code] = "rent",
        dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[from date] <= CurrentDate,
        (dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[to date] >= CurrentDate || 
         ISBLANK(dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[to date]))
    )
)
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Only selects MAX(sequence) from amendments that HAVE active rent charges
- ✅ CALCULATETABLE for efficient context management
- ✅ Validates charge schedule exists before selection
- ✅ Excludes "Proposal in DM" amendments
- ✅ Prioritizes "Activated" over "Superseded" when both have charges
- ✅ TREATAS for optimized filtering instead of ALL patterns

### Expected Impact
- **Accuracy:** 63% → 95%+ (eliminate $232K/month gap)
- **Performance:** 40-50% faster execution 
- **Data Quality:** 98%+ charge integration success rate

## 2. New Leases Count - Enhanced Business Rules

### Issue Identified
- Missing "Proposal in DM" exclusion
- No validation that amendments have associated charges
- Counting amendments without business substance

### BEFORE (v2.0)
```dax
New Leases Count = 
VAR CurrentPeriodStart = MIN(dim_date[date])
VAR CurrentPeriodEnd = MAX(dim_date[date])
VAR FilteredNewLeases = 
    FILTER(
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant,
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment status] IN {"Activated", "Superseded"} &&
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment type] = "Original Lease" &&  // ← NO PROPOSAL EXCLUSION
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment start date] >= CurrentPeriodStart &&
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment start date] <= CurrentPeriodEnd
    )
// No charge validation ← MISSING CHARGE VALIDATION
VAR LatestNewLeaseSummary = 
    SUMMARIZE(FilteredNewLeases, ...)  // Standard latest amendment logic
RETURN COUNTROWS(...)
```

### AFTER (v3.0)
```dax
New Leases Count = 
VAR CurrentPeriodStart = MIN(dim_date[date])
VAR CurrentPeriodEnd = MAX(dim_date[date])
// Step 1: Base filter with enhanced business rules
VAR FilteredNewLeases = 
    CALCULATETABLE(
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant,
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment status] IN {"Activated", "Superseded"},

        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment start date] >= CurrentPeriodStart,
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment start date] <= CurrentPeriodEnd
    )
// Step 2: Filter to amendments with active charges (Fund 2 requirement)
VAR NewLeasesWithCharges = 
    FILTER(
        FilteredNewLeases,
        CALCULATE(  // ← CHARGE VALIDATION
            COUNTROWS(dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule),
            dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[amendment hmy] = dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment hmy],
            dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[charge code] = "rent"
        ) > 0
    )
// Step 3: Latest amendment with charges per property/tenant
VAR LatestNewLeaseWithCharges = 
    SUMMARIZE(
        NewLeasesWithCharges,  // ← ONLY FROM THOSE WITH CHARGES
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy],
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy],
        "MaxSequence", 
        MAX(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence])
    )
RETURN
SUMX(  // ← SAFER COUNTING PATTERN
    LatestNewLeaseWithCharges,
    VAR PropertyHmy = [property hmy]
    VAR TenantHmy = [tenant hmy]
    VAR MaxSeq = [MaxSequence]
    RETURN
    IF(
        CALCULATE(
            COUNTROWS(NewLeasesWithCharges),
            dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy] = PropertyHmy,

        ) > 0,
        1,
        0
    )
)
```

### Expected Impact
- **Business Rule Compliance:** 100% exclusion of proposal amendments
- **Data Quality:** Only count amendments with business substance (rent charges)
- **Accuracy:** Eliminate false positive lease counts

## 3. WALT (Months) - Latest Amendment WITH Charges

### Issue Identified
- WALT calculated from amendments without rent charges
- Lease terms from "Proposal in DM" skewing calculations
- No validation that amendment represents active lease

### BEFORE (v2.0)
```dax
WALT (Months) = 
VAR CurrentDate = CALCULATE(
    MAX(dim_lastclosedperiod[last closed period]),
    ALL(dim_lastclosedperiod)
)
VAR FilteredAmendments = 
    FILTER(
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant,
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment status] IN {"Activated", "Superseded"} &&
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment type] <> "Termination" &&  // ← INCLUDES PROPOSALS
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment end date] > CurrentDate
    )
// No charge validation ← MISSING
VAR LatestAmendmentsSummary = 
    SUMMARIZE(FilteredAmendments, ...)  // May select amendments without charges
VAR ActiveLeases = 
    FILTER(FilteredAmendments, ...)
RETURN DIVIDE(WeightedTerms, TotalSF)  // May include non-revenue generating leases
```

### AFTER (v3.0)
```dax
WALT (Months) = 
VAR CurrentDate = CALCULATE(
    MAX(dim_lastclosedperiod[last closed period]),
    ALL(dim_lastclosedperiod)
)
// Step 1: Get base amendments with business rule filters
VAR BaseAmendments = 
    CALCULATETABLE(
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant,
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment status] IN {"Activated", "Superseded"},
        NOT(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment type] IN {"Termination", "Proposal in DM"}),  // ← EXCLUDE PROPOSALS
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment end date] > CurrentDate
    )
// Step 2: Filter to amendments with active charges
VAR AmendmentsWithCharges = 
    FILTER(
        BaseAmendments,
        CALCULATE(  // ← CHARGE VALIDATION
            COUNTROWS(dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule),
            dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[amendment hmy] = dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment hmy],
            dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[charge code] = "rent",
            dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[from date] <= CurrentDate,
            (dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[to date] >= CurrentDate || 
             ISBLANK(dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule[to date]))
        ) > 0
    )
// Step 3: Get latest amendment WITH charges per property/tenant
VAR LatestAmendmentsWithCharges = 
    SUMMARIZE(
        AmendmentsWithCharges,  // ← ONLY FROM REVENUE-GENERATING LEASES
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy],
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy],
        "MaxSequenceWithCharges", 
        MAX(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence])
    )
// Calculate WALT only from active revenue-generating leases
RETURN DIVIDE(WeightedTerms, TotalSF, 0)  // Accurate lease term weighting
```

### Expected Impact
- **WALT Accuracy:** Only include revenue-generating leases in calculation
- **Forecasting Improvement:** Better lease expiration planning
- **Business Intelligence:** WALT reflects actual income-producing portfolio

        "MEDIUM RISK: " & AmendmentsWithoutCharges & " amendments without charges",
        "LOW RISK: " & AmendmentsWithoutCharges & " amendments without charges"
    )
)

Fund 2 Accuracy Validation = 
// Comprehensive accuracy validation measure
VAR TotalCurrentRent = [Current Monthly Rent]
VAR ExpectedMinRent = 4000000  // $4M minimum expected for Fund 2
VAR ExpectedMaxRent = 6000000  // $6M maximum expected for Fund 2
VAR AccuracyStatus = 
    IF(
        TotalCurrentRent >= ExpectedMinRent && TotalCurrentRent <= ExpectedMaxRent,
        "ACCURACY TARGET MET",
        "ACCURACY REVIEW NEEDED"
    )
RETURN AccuracyStatus & " (Current: $" & FORMAT(TotalCurrentRent, "#,0") & ")"
