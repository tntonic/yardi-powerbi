Subject: Fund 2 Rent Roll Accuracy Improvements - Implementation Starting August 9

Dear Stakeholders,

We are implementing critical accuracy improvements to the Fund 2 rent roll calculations that will:
- Improve accuracy from 63% to 95%+ vs Yardi
- Eliminate $232K/month calculation gap  
- Add real-time data quality monitoring

Timeline:
- August 9-11: Development and testing
- August 12-16: Validation and user acceptance
- August 19-23: Production deployment and monitoring

Expected downtime: 2-4 hours on August 19 for production deployment.

Please contact [BI Team] with any questions.

Best regards,
Power BI Team
```

### Day 2: Data Validation Preparation

#### 2.1 Fund 2 Data Verification
- [ ] **Validate Fund 2 property scope**: Confirm all X-prefix properties included
- [ ] **Check data refresh status**: Ensure latest data available
- [ ] **Verify amendment sequence integrity**: No gaps or duplicates
- [ ] **Validate charge schedule completeness**: Check missing charges baseline

**Validation Queries:**
```sql
-- Fund 2 Property Count Verification
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT property_code) as fund2_properties
FROM dim_property 
WHERE property_code LIKE 'x%';

-- Amendment Sequence Integrity Check
SELECT property_hmy, tenant_hmy, COUNT(*) as sequence_count,
       MIN(amendment_sequence) as min_seq, MAX(amendment_sequence) as max_seq
FROM dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant
WHERE amendment_status IN ('Activated', 'Superseded')
GROUP BY property_hmy, tenant_hmy
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Missing Charges Baseline
SELECT COUNT(*) as amendments_without_charges
FROM dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant a
LEFT JOIN dim_fp_amendmentchargeschedule c ON a.amendment_hmy = c.amendment_hmy
WHERE a.amendment_status IN ('Activated', 'Superseded')
  AND a.amendment_type NOT IN ('Termination', 'Proposal in DM')
  AND c.amendment_hmy IS NULL;
```

#### 2.2 Test Data Preparation
- [ ] **Create Fund 2 test dataset** (subset of 50-100 properties)
- [ ] **Prepare validation scenarios**:
  - Properties with multiple amendment sequences
  - Amendments with/without charge schedules
  - "Proposal in DM" amendments (should be excluded)
  - Month-to-month leases (null end dates)
- [ ] **Generate expected results** for test scenarios

#### 2.3 Yardi Native Report Acquisition
- [ ] **Request latest Fund 2 rent roll** from Yardi (as of implementation date)
- [ ] **Parse Yardi export** into comparable format
- [ ] **Identify key validation metrics**:
  - Total monthly rent by property
  - Total leased SF by property
  - Tenant count by property
  - Average rent PSF by property

### Day 3: Development Environment Testing

#### 3.1 Initial DAX Implementation
- [ ] **Open development Power BI file**
- [ ] **Import v3.0 DAX measures** from Complete_DAX_Library_v3_Fund2_Fixed.dax
- [ ] **Validate syntax** - ensure all measures compile without errors
- [ ] **Test individual measures** on small data subset

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Open Power BI Desktop with development file
2. Go to Model view → New measure
3. Copy/paste DAX measures from v3.0 library
4. For each measure, verify:
   - No syntax errors (red underlines)
   - Measure appears in Fields pane
   - Can be dragged to table visual without errors

#### 3.2 Basic Functionality Testing
- [ ] **Test core measures**:
  - Current Monthly Rent (should show realistic values)
  - Current Leased SF (should show realistic SF totals)
  - Fund 2 Data Quality Score (should be 80%+)
  - Fund 2 Missing Charges Alert (should show current status)

- [ ] **Verify business logic**:
  - "Proposal in DM" amendments excluded
  - Latest amendment WITH charges logic working
  - Status prioritization (Activated > Superseded)

#### 3.3 Performance Initial Check
- [ ] **Test dashboard load times** with v3.0 measures
- [ ] **Compare to v2.0 baseline** performance
- [ ] **Identify any significant performance regressions**
- [ ] **Document initial performance results**

---

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing & Validation (Days 4-8)

- [ ] **Document edge cases**: Note any patterns in failed selections

**Scenario 3: Data Quality Validation**
- [ ] **Run Fund 2 Data Quality Score** 
- [ ] **Target**: 90%+ overall score
- [ ] **Break down components**: Charge integration, business rules, status distribution

    FILTER(
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant,
        ISBLANK(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment end date])
    )
)
```
- [ ] **Verify inclusion**: Should include rent from month-to-month leases
- [ ] **Compare to exclusion**: Test without null end date handling
- [ ] **Validate impact**: Document contribution of month-to-month leases

**Edge Case 2: Amendment Sequence Gaps**
- [ ] **Identify properties** with non-consecutive sequences (1,3,5 instead of 1,2,3)
- [ ] **Verify selection**: Should select highest sequence number
- [ ] **Manual validation**: Spot-check 5-10 cases manually

**Edge Case 3: Multiple Status at Same Sequence**
- [ ] **Find cases** where property/tenant has both Activated and Superseded at same sequence
- [ ] **Verify prioritization**: Should select Activated over Superseded
- [ ] **Document resolution**: Confirm status prioritization working

#### 4.3 Business Rule Compliance Testing

**Rule 1: "Proposal in DM" Exclusion**
```dax
// Test measure to verify proposal exclusion
Proposal in DM Count = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant),
    dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment type] = "Proposal in DM",
    dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment status] IN {"Activated", "Superseded"}
)
```
- [ ] **Baseline count**: Document how many "Proposal in DM" amendments exist
- [ ] **Verify exclusion**: Ensure these don't contribute to rent calculations
- [ ] **Impact measurement**: Calculate potential revenue impact of exclusion

**Rule 2: Termination Exclusion**
- [ ] **Verify terminated leases** excluded from current calculations
