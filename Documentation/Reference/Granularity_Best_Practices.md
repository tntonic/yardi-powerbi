# Table Granularity Specifications

## Overview

This document defines the granularity (grain) of each table in the Yardi BI data model, essential for accurate aggregations and preventing double-counting in calculations.

## Understanding Granularity

### Granularity Definitions
- **Lowest Granularity (Finest Detail)**: The most detailed level at which data is stored
- **Highest Granularity (Coarsest Aggregation)**: The most summarized level
- **Natural Grain**: The inherent level of detail that makes business sense

## Fact Table Granularity

### fact_total
```
Grain: Property + Month + Book + Account + Amount Type
Primary Key: Composite of above fields
Row Represents: A single financial transaction or journal entry

Granularity Levels:
- Lowest: Individual GL line items by property/month/book/account
- Natural: Monthly financial activity by property and account
- Highest: Total portfolio financial summary

Volume Indicators:
- Rows per property per month: 100-500 typically
- Total rows: Millions for multi-year history

Aggregation Rules:
- Sum amounts within same account range for totals
- Filter by amount_type = 'Actual' for realized transactions
- Filter by book for specific reporting views
```

### fact_occupancyrentarea
```

```

### fact_expiringleaseunitarea
```
Grain: Property + Tenant + Unit + Lease Dates

Granularity Levels:
- Lowest: Individual unit leases
- Natural: Tenant leases by property
- Highest: Portfolio lease expiration summary

Volume Indicators:
- Rows per property: Equal to number of active leases
- Changes with lease activity

Aggregation Rules:
- Sum expiring_area for total expiring square footage
- Count distinct tenants for tenant counts
- Filter by date ranges for expiration analysis
```

### fact_accountsreceivable
```
Grain: Property + Tenant + Invoice Date + Invoice Number
Primary Key: Composite of above fields
Row Represents: Individual AR invoice or payment

Granularity Levels:
- Lowest: Individual invoice line items
- Natural: Tenant AR balances by property
- Highest: Portfolio AR summary

Aggregation Rules:
- Sum amounts for total AR
- Age by invoice_date for aging buckets
- Group by tenant for collection analysis
```

### fact_fp_fmvm_marketunitrates
```

- Latest profile date for current market rates
- Compare with actual rents for gap analysis
```

## Dimension Table Granularity

### dim_property
```
Grain: One row per property
Primary Key: property_id
Natural Key: property_code
Row Represents: A single real estate property

Cardinality: Low (typically 10s to 100s of properties)
Relationships: One-to-many with most fact tables
```

### dim_unit
```
Grain: One row per rentable unit
Primary Key: unit_id
Natural Key: property_id + unit_code
Row Represents: A single rentable space within a property

Relationships: Many-to-one with dim_property
```

### dim_commcustomer / dim_commlease
```
Grain: One row per tenant/customer
Primary Key: customer_id or tenant_id
Row Represents: A commercial tenant entity

- Latest sequence determines current lease terms
- Historical amendments retained for audit trail

Aggregation Rules:
- Filter for MAX(sequence) per property/tenant for current
- Include Superseded status in latest sequence logic
- Exclude Termination type for active leases
```

Purpose: Multi-unit lease tracking

Usage:
- Tracks which units are in each amendment
- Handles multi-unit leases
```

## Aggregation Best Practices

### Property Level Aggregations
```dax
// Always aggregate at property level first for performance
Property Summary = 
SUMMARIZE(
    fact_total,
    dim_property[property_id],
    dim_property[property_name],
    "Total Revenue", [Total Revenue],
    "Total Expenses", [Operating Expenses],
    "NOI", [NOI (Net Operating Income)]
)
```

### Time-Based Aggregations
```dax
// Be explicit about time grain
Monthly Summary = 
SUMMARIZE(
    fact_total,
    dim_date[year],
    dim_date[month],
    "Monthly Total", SUM(fact_total[amount])
)
```

### Avoiding Double-Counting
```dax
// Use DISTINCTCOUNT for unique counts across grains
Unique Tenant Count = 
DISTINCTCOUNT(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant_hmy])

// Not SUM of counts which would double-count
```

### Handling Different Grains
```dax
// When mixing different grain tables, use appropriate aggregation
Combined Metric = 
VAR MonthlyFinancials = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Total Revenue],
        fact_total[month] = MAX(dim_date[date])
    )
VAR CurrentOccupancy = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Physical Occupancy %],
        fact_occupancyrentarea[first_day_of_month] = EOMONTH(MAX(dim_date[date]), 0)
    )
RETURN
    MonthlyFinancials * CurrentOccupancy
```

## Common Granularity Pitfalls

### 1. Amendment Sequence Confusion
```
Problem: Not filtering for latest sequence causes duplicate tenants
Solution: Always use MAX(sequence) per property/tenant
```

### 2. Time Period Misalignment
```
Problem: Mixing different time grains (daily vs monthly)
Solution: Standardize to common grain (usually monthly)
```

### 3. Book Aggregation
```
Problem: Summing across all books inflates totals
Solution: Filter to specific book before aggregation
```

### 4. Status Filtering
```
Problem: Only including "Activated" misses valid "Superseded" records
Solution: Include both statuses in amendment queries
```

## Validation Queries

### Check Granularity
```sql
-- Verify fact_total grain
SELECT 
    property_id,
    month,
    book_id,
    account_id,
    amount_type,
    COUNT(*) as row_count
FROM fact_total
GROUP BY 
    property_id,
    month,
    book_id,
    account_id,
    amount_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;  -- Should return no rows if grain is correct

-- Verify amendment grain
SELECT 
    property_hmy,
    tenant_hmy,
    amendment_sequence,
    COUNT(*) as amendment_count
FROM dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant
WHERE amendment_status IN ('Activated', 'Superseded')
GROUP BY 
    property_hmy,
    tenant_hmy,
    amendment_sequence
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;  -- Should return no rows if grain is correct
```

### Monitor Row Counts
```sql
-- Table row count summary
SELECT 
    'fact_total' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as row_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT property_id) as unique_properties,
    COUNT(DISTINCT month) as unique_months
FROM fact_total
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'fact_occupancyrentarea',
    COUNT(*),
    COUNT(DISTINCT property_id),
    COUNT(DISTINCT first_day_of_month)
FROM fact_occupancyrentarea
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant',
    COUNT(*),
    COUNT(DISTINCT property_hmy),
    COUNT(DISTINCT tenant_hmy)
FROM dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant;
```

## Performance Impact of Grain

### Storage Optimization
- Lower grain = more rows = more storage
- Consider summary tables for frequently accessed aggregations
- Partition large fact tables by date

### Query Performance
- Filter early in the query to reduce row processing
- Use the appropriate grain level for the analysis
- Create aggregated tables for dashboard performance

### Incremental Refresh Strategy
- Monthly grain allows monthly refresh windows
- Daily grain requires more frequent updates
- Balance freshness needs with processing resources
