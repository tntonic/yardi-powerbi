## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Fund Property Definition Issues ‚ùå CRITICAL

**Problem:** Current Fund 2 filtered data (195 properties) captures only a fraction of required activity.

**Evidence:**
- Original Fund 2 Q1 terminations: 156,735 SF (Target: 712,000 SF)
- Enhanced Fund 2 Q1 terminations: 383,169 SF (Target: 712,000 SF)
- Still missing 328,831 SF (46%) even with enhanced definition

**Analysis:** FPR benchmarks likely use a broader fund definition than available in filtered data.

### 2. Methodology Discrepancy ‚ùå HIGH

**Same-Store Definition Mismatch:**
- **Current Logic:** Acquired before period start, not disposed during period
- **FPR Logic:** Unknown - may use different same-store criteria

**Date Filtering Differences:**
- **Current Logic:** Amendment start/end dates for period filtering
- **FPR Logic:** May use different date fields or ranges

**Status Filtering Variations:**
- **Current Logic:** "Activated" and "Superseded" amendments only
- **FPR Logic:** May include additional statuses or different logic

### 3. Fund 3 Identification Failure ‚ùå CRITICAL

**Problem:** No reliable method to identify Fund 3 properties from available data.

**Attempts Made:**
- Property name pattern matching: 0 matches
- Fund column analysis: No fund column exists
- High activity property analysis: Resulted in negative accuracies

**Impact:** Cannot validate Fund 3 measures without proper property identification.

## Business Impact Assessment

### Immediate Risks

1. **Dashboard Reliability (CRITICAL):** Current measures show 2.5% accuracy, making dashboards unreliable
2. **Executive Reporting (HIGH):** FPR benchmark comparisons are invalid with current implementation
3. **Investment Decisions (HIGH):** Inaccurate net absorption data affects portfolio analysis
4. **Compliance (MEDIUM):** Discrepancies create audit risk for regulatory reporting

### Data Quality Implications

1. **Fund Segmentation:** Current fund definitions may not align with business requirements
2. **Historical Analysis:** Cannot perform accurate trend analysis with current measures
3. **Cross-Validation:** Significant gaps between internal calculations and external benchmarks

## Data Quality Findings

### Fund 2 Data Quality Assessment

| **Metric** | **Original** | **Enhanced** | **Target** | **Gap Analysis** |
|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|------------------|
| Q1 2025 Terminations | 156,735 SF | 383,169 SF | 712,000 SF | Still missing 328,831 SF |
| Q1 2025 New Leases | 20,793 SF | 20,793 SF | 198,000 SF | Missing 177,207 SF |
| Q2 2025 Terminations | 264,057 SF | 264,057 SF | 458,000 SF | Missing 193,943 SF |
| Q2 2025 New Leases | 96,856 SF | 96,856 SF | 258,000 SF | Missing 161,144 SF |

**Key Insight:** Even with enhanced property lists, significant activity remains unaccounted for, suggesting methodology differences beyond property scope.

### Fund 3 Data Quality Assessment

**Status:** ‚ùå **INCOMPLETE - Business validation required**

- No reliable fund identification method in current data
- Initial property list based on activity analysis, not business rules
- Negative accuracies indicate fundamental scope misalignment
- Requires complete redefinition based on business input

## Conclusion

This validation has identified critical gaps between current Same-Store Net Absorption measures and FPR benchmarks. While enhanced fund filtering shows improvement (Fund 2 Q2 Net Absorption reached 83.6% accuracy), significant methodology and scope alignment is required to achieve production-ready accuracy standards.

**The enhanced DAX measures and Python validation framework provide a solid foundation for implementation once business validation of fund definitions and calculation methodology is complete.**

**Immediate business stakeholder input is critical to resolve fund property scope and calculation methodology discrepancies before production deployment.**
