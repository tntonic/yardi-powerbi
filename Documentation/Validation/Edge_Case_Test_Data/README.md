# Edge Case Test Data - README

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive edge case test scenarios for the 9 critical rent roll DAX measures that have been updated with optimized MAX(amendment sequence) filters. The framework ensures production robustness by testing all possible data variations in the Yardi commercial real estate environment.

7. **Renewal Rent Change %** - Rent growth analysis

## Test Categories Covered

### 1. Amendment Sequence Edge Cases
- Multiple amendments per tenant (testing MAX sequence selection)
- Gaps in amendment sequences
- Duplicate sequence numbers (data quality issues)

### 2. Amendment Status Edge Cases
- Latest amendment with "Superseded" status
- Termination amendments (should be excluded)
- Draft and cancelled statuses (should be excluded)

### 3. Date Boundary Edge Cases
- Month-end boundaries (28, 29, 30, 31 day months)
- Year-end and fiscal year boundaries
- Leap year scenarios
- Null end dates (month-to-month leases)
- Future start dates
- Recently expired leases
- Exact boundary conditions (expires today, started yesterday)

### 4. Financial Calculation Edge Cases
- Zero rent amounts
- Negative rent (tenant improvements, credits)
- Extremely large rent amounts
- Division by zero scenarios (zero square footage)
- Complex charge structures (base + CAM + insurance + tax)
- Rounding and precision scenarios

### 5. Property/Tenant Relationship Edge Cases
- Same tenant in multiple properties
- Multiple units in same amendment
- Orphaned amendment records

### 6. Missing Data Edge Cases
- Null amendment square footage
- Null monthly amounts
- Missing start/end dates

### 7. Leasing Activity Edge Cases
- Activity type classification (New, Renewal, Termination)
- Rent change calculations for renewals
- Date-based activity filtering

### 8. Performance and Scalability Edge Cases
- High volume amendment data (1K to 1M records)
- Complex filtering scenarios
- Concurrent user load testing
- Memory usage and resource management

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Load Test Data
```
1. Import all CSV files into your Power BI model
2. Establish relationships between tables
3. Verify data loads without errors
```

### Step 2: Create Validation Measures
```
1. Copy DAX measures from edge_case_validation_measures.dax
2. Create measures in a "Validation" folder in your model
3. Test basic measure execution
```

### Step 3: Run Core Test Scenarios
```
1. Follow test_execution_guide.md for detailed steps
2. Start with Amendment Sequence tests (Test 1.1-1.3)
3. Progress through all test categories systematically
4. Document results using provided tracking templates
```

### Step 4: Validate Expected Results
```
1. Compare actual results against validation_expected_results.csv
2. Flag any discrepancies for investigation
3. Document performance metrics during testing
```

## Expected Test Results Summary

### Amendment Logic Tests
- **PROP001, TEN001**: Should select sequence 3, rent $6,000, SF 2,500
- **PROP002, TEN002**: Should select sequence 5 despite gap, rent $3,200
- **PROP004, TEN004**: Should include "Superseded" status, rent $4,500

### Date Boundary Tests (Report Date: 2025-06-30)
- **Null end dates**: Should be included in current rent roll
- **Future start dates**: Should be excluded from current rent roll
- **Expired leases**: Should be excluded from current rent roll
- **12-month expiring**: Properties expiring by 2026-06-30 should be included

### Financial Calculation Tests
- **Zero rent**: Should handle without errors, PSF = $0.00
- **Division by zero**: Should return 0, not error
- **Negative amounts**: Should calculate net rent correctly

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Single measures**: <5 seconds execution time
- **Dashboard loading**: <10 seconds with filters
- **Large datasets**: Graceful degradation up to 100K+ records

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements ✅
- All measures handle edge cases without errors
- MAX(sequence) selection works correctly in all scenarios  
- Both "Activated" and "Superseded" statuses properly included
- Date boundary conditions handled appropriately
- Null/missing data handled gracefully

### Performance Requirements ✅
- Query execution <5 seconds for single measure
- Dashboard response <10 seconds with multiple measures
- Handles 100K+ amendment records efficiently

### Business Logic Requirements ✅
- WALT calculations accurate for all date scenarios
- Expiration tracking works correctly at boundaries
- Leasing activity metrics sum correctly
- Rent PSF calculations handle zero/null divisions
