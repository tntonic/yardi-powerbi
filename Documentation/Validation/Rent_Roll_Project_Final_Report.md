## Solution Architecture

### Technical Approach
The solution implemented a standardized **Amendment-Based Accuracy Pattern** across all measures:

1. **Status Expansion:** Include both "Activated" and "Superseded" amendments
2. **Sequence Filtering:** Apply MAX(amendment sequence) logic per property/tenant
3. **Performance Optimization:** Early filtering and SUMMARIZE patterns
4. **Consistency:** Standardized variable naming and calculation patterns

### Core Innovation: Latest Amendment Logic
```dax
-- Revolutionary amendment filtering pattern
VAR LatestAmendmentsSummary = 
    SUMMARIZE(
        FilteredAmendments,
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy],
        dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy],
        "MaxSequence", 
        CALCULATE(
            MAX(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[amendment sequence]),
            FILTER(
                FilteredAmendments,
                dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy] = EARLIER(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[property hmy]) &&
                dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy] = EARLIER(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant[tenant hmy])
            )
        )
    )
```

### Validation Framework
