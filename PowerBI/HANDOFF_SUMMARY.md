# Power BI Validation Handoff Summary

## Quick Context
Comprehensive validation of Power BI implementation for Yardi BI analytics. Target: 95-99% accuracy for rent roll, 95-98% for leasing activity.

## Current Status - August 9, 2025
- **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETED (Architecture & Business Logic Review)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ COMPLETED (DAX Measure Testing & Validation)
- **Phase 3**: ✅ COMPLETED (Data Quality & Accuracy Validation)
- **Phase 4-7**: ⏳ PENDING (Performance, Dashboard Review, Documentation, Monitoring)

## Overall Validation Score: 85% (Target: 95%)
- **Rent Roll Accuracy**: ~93% (Target: 95-99%) ❌
- **Leasing Activity Accuracy**: ~91% (Target: 95-98%) ❌
- **Financial Accuracy**: ~96% (Target: 98%+) ⚠️

## Key Findings from Phase 1

### Architecture (Score: 9/10)
- 32-table star schema validated
- Hybrid architecture: amendment details + summary tables
- Critical: Amendment sequence logic for rent roll accuracy
- Single-direction relationships (except Calendar bi-directional)

### Business Logic (Score: 96/100)
- 122 DAX measures validated
- ✅ Amendment logic: MAX(sequence) + Activated/Superseded status
- ✅ Revenue sign: multiply by -1
- ❌ 3 typos need fixing (TweleveMonthsOut → TwelveMonthsOut)

## Critical Pattern to Remember
```dax
// Rent roll latest amendment selection
FILTER(
    ALL(dim_fp_amendmentsunitspropertytenant),
    [amendment sequence] = CALCULATE(
        MAX([amendment sequence]),
        ALLEXCEPT(..., [property hmy], [tenant hmy])
    )
) &&
[amendment status] IN {"Activated", "Superseded"}
```

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
1. Test occupancy calculations (8 measures)
2. Test financial measures (14 measures)
3. Test rent roll measures (10 measures) - CRITICAL
4. Test leasing activity measures (15 measures)
5. Run data quality analysis

## Files Created
1. `Architecture_Review_Report.md` - Full architecture analysis
2. `Business_Logic_Validation_Report.md` - DAX validation details
3. `Validation_Progress.md` - Complete plan & progress
4. `Phase2_DAX_Testing_Results.md` - Testing results documentation
5. `dim_market_data.csv` - Market reference data table

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. Fix 3 typos in DAX measures
2. Create market data reference table
3. Execute Phase 2 DAX testing
4. Run Phase 3 data quality analysis

## Critical Issues Found (Phase 2-3 Validation)

### 1. Orphaned Property Records - HIGHEST PRIORITY ❌
- **Issue**: 20.92% of fact_total records reference non-existent properties
- **Impact**: Major impact on financial reporting accuracy
- **Fix Required**: Reconcile dim_property with fact_total immediately

### 2. Multiple Active Amendments ⚠️
- **Issue**: 180 property/tenant combinations have multiple active amendments
- **Impact**: Causes rent roll calculation errors
- **Fix Required**: Implement proper latest amendment selection logic

### 3. Missing Tables ⚠️
- **Issue**: Only 29 of 32 expected tables found
- **Impact**: May affect some advanced analytics features
- **Fix Required**: Identify and import missing tables

### 4. Revenue Sign Convention ⚠️
- **Issue**: 8% of revenue records have positive values (should be negative)
- **Impact**: Affects revenue calculations
- **Fix Required**: Correct sign convention for 4xxxx accounts

## Positive Findings
- ✅ Amendment table coverage: 99.9% of property/tenant combinations
- ✅ Business logic verified - correct calculation patterns
- ✅ Date dimension coverage exceeds requirements (2017-2065)
- ✅ All 122 DAX measures tested and functional

## Files Created/Updated
1. `Architecture_Review_Report.md` - Full architecture analysis
2. `Business_Logic_Validation_Report.md` - DAX validation details
3. `Validation_Progress.md` - Complete plan & progress (UPDATED Aug 9)

## Immediate Actions Required for Target Accuracy
1. **Fix orphaned property records** - 20.92% of fact_total affected
2. **Resolve multiple active amendments** - 180 cases
3. **Import missing tables** - 3 tables needed
4. **Fix revenue sign convention** - 8% of records
5. **Add date filtering to rent calculations** - exclude expired leases
